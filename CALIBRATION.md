# Calibration

On the first time starting the software it is going to ask you to calibrate your camera.
To start this process you are going to need to print the calibration board, which can be found 
[here](https://github.com/alexcwu1121/stress_in_beams_AR/blob/master/resources/dict4board.jpg).

Cut the board out and then you need to adhesie it to a flat surface. I recommend using glue or tape. If you are using glue, make sure there are no bubbles or any weird textures as a result of the glue. You need the board to be as smooth/flat as possible. If you are using tape, only use tape as a border, do not put the tape on top of the markers.

Once the above is completed you can move on to the actual calibration. The software will ask you 10 captures at various angles. When do the captures make sure that all or a siginificant majority of the markers on the board are recognized, recognized meaning that there is a stable green border around the marker.

Some angles that I recommend for the best calibration are:
- head on
- tilted left
- tilted right
- tilted up
- tilted down
- tilted up and to the right
- tilted up and to the left
- tilted down and to the right
- tilted down and to the left

The calibration will only require 1 more capture, this can be from any angle as long as the captures above are met.

After this you should be done with calibration.
