# Making a Beam

If you are new to the project and don't have a beam to use, this file will show you how to make a beam.

You will need to print all 3 MultiMarkerBodies found in [resources](https://github.com/alexcwu1121/stress_in_beams_AR/tree/master/resources). You will need to print out 'group_1.png', 'group_2.png', and 'group_3.png' so that the MultiMarkerBodies are each a 2x2 matrix of markers.

Next, you will need to get a foam beam that bends easily. Getting your hands on a foam beam will be up to you.

Once you have both of these you will need to mount the MultiMarkerBodies to the beam. In the example below, the flat piece that the MultiMarkerBodies are glued to were 3D printed specifically for this purpose. Then duct tape was used to strap the MultiMarkerBodies to beam.

Example of complete beam:
